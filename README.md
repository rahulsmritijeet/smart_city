# smart_city
Here’s my first big project — building a smart city for school. It’s all about mixing IoT and hands-on tinkering to create something practical, cool, and problem-solving for countries like India where people tend to have less civic sense and the infrastructure is not really great. Sharing what I learn and build along the way!
